<Setting up basic infrastructure for distributed data mining> -  3 minutes (1 person)

Maybe some Intro and purpose of the course

Created VMs and a cluster via SSH

Installed Hadoop (with very brief explanation of the concept)

Installed Spark (with very brief explanation of the concept)

———————————————— 1 min

Reviewed the pros and cons of each frameworks (brief) - mainly focus on number of iterations and use of cache 

Tested simple test cases on both Hadoop and Spark using different languages, and compared the performance 

Set up Hadoop and Spark UI to visualise the process
Test 1 : Prime number (in Python, Java, Scala) on Spark
Test 2 : Pi calculation (python) on Hadoop
Test 3: Word Count (war and peace by Tolstoy - in python on both Spark and Hadoop
Comparison (WC example) : Spark was slightly faster but mainly due to small size of the input file and we expect spark to over perform for bigger sized inputs.
